Mini Project 1
Lab Exercise - Page 91 Module 4 Instead of doing this lab exercise we will work on our mini project ideas instead.
Treat this like a mini-project we'll give 8-10 hours~ of class time.
Utilise what you have learnt so far to create a rich Front-end application.
Follow these steps below
- Start with figuring out what you want to show, for example, a hobby of yours, you don't need to make social posts
page. (Search for an api that you can use for that hobby).
- Create requirements, do some research, perhaps Pinterest to get some ideas. (Requirements Gathering)
- Prepare your lo-fi / sketches
- Prepare your application on Figma
- Fully complete the requirements gathering process/designing before you code!!
- Get Coding and remember to use responsive design. (Use HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap)
- At least one fetch API call and good use of it (showing the data)
- Add things such as animations, time(moment.js), charts. (focus on this last, but ideally at least one Animation)
Discuss the application with your lead trainer and assistant trainer, in order to get feedback.
- Upload everything to GitHub, potentially, make a GitHub page. You may want to
start showcasing your knowledge. Your github readME should be well documented.
- Finally, you will be presenting your projects to the class (5mins~)
Talking points
1. What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?
2. Give a high level overview of your application and its features
3. Where does its data come from (external APIs)?
4. What JS techniques have you used (eg. objects, arrays, DOM functions, loops, functions)?
5. How can the user interact with this data?
5. What external tools/libraries have you used (eg. bootstrap/axios/charts)? How? Why?
6. What kinds of HTML elements have you used (eg. tables, forms, divs, lists, headings, menus, videos, images)?
7. What kinds of CSS features have you used (eg. animations, backgrounds, fonts, colours, flexbox, grid)?
8. How might you extend the features of your application in future?
I have shared a google sheets to you all with a list of free api's that could be interesting/easier for you to use.
